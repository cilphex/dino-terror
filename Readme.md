### An Educational Spelling Game for Children

Back in college, me and a few others made this game as a group project for Software Engineering class.  The only things included here are the necessary game files, not the source.  I may have lost it, but if I find it I'll add that too.

The game is nothing impressive relative to any of our current talent, but looking back it's pretty darn funny.
