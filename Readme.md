### An Educational Spelling Game for Children

Back in college, me and a few others made this game as a group project for Software Engineering class.  The only things included here are the necessary game files, not the source.  I may have lost it, but if I find it I'll add that too.

The game is nothing impressive relative to any of our current talent, but looking back it's pretty darn funny.

Once you start up, you can sign in as user:craig/password:craig to get started playing as a student.  Or read README.txt to see how to sign in as root, who can create teachers, who can create more students.
